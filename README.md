## Temporal Sigmoid Belief Network

The Matlab Code for the NIPS 2015 paper "Deep Temporal Sigmoid Belief Networks for Sequence Modeling"

Zhe Gan (zhe.gan@duke.edu), 9.18.2015

## Introduction

This code implement the Temporal Sigmoid Belief Network(TSBN), from the 2015 NIPS paper with the same title. 
This source code is made publicly available for reproducibility purposes, it is not optimized for speed, 
minimally documented but fully functional.

## Getting started

We create one folder for each dataset, and give the detailed implementation notes inside. 

## License

Please note that this code should be used at your own risk. There is no implied guarantee that it will
not do anything stupid. Permission is granted to use and modify the code.

## Citing TSBN

Please cite our NIPS paper in your publications if it helps your research:
