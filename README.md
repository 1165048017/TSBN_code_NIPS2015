## Temporal Sigmoid Belief Network

The Matlab Code and the Supplementary Material for the NIPS 2015 paper "Deep Temporal Sigmoid Belief Networks for Sequence Modeling"

## Introduction

This code implement the Temporal Sigmoid Belief Network(TSBN), from the 2015 NIPS paper with the same title. 
This source code is made publicly available for reproducibility purposes, it is not optimized for speed, 
minimally documented but fully functional.

## Getting started

1. go to the folder ./supp to see the synthesized mocap motion and polyphonic music by running our model. 

2.  go to the folder ./src to check the matlab code. For each dataset, we give the detailed implementation details inside.
