## How to use the code

You need first generate your own bouncing_balls dataset according to the python file inside the folder ./data.

1. balls_ar.m : an order-1 auto-regressive Markov model without latent variables;

2. balls_ar_delay.m : a high-order auto-regressive Markov model without latent variables;

3. balls_dtsbn_deter.m : a two-layer TSBN model with deterministic middle hidden layer;

4. balls_dtsbn_stoc.m : a two-layer TSBN model with stochastic middle hidden layer;

5. balls_hmsbn.m : a one-layer HMSBN model with order 1;

6. balls_tsbn.m : a one-layer TSBN model with order 1;

7. balls_tsbn_delay.m : a one-layer TSBN model with any order specification;

8. visualize.m : visualize your inout bouncing ball data in Matlab.
