## How to use the code

The original polyphonic music data can be downloaded from http://www-etud.iro.umontreal.ca/~boulanni/icml2012, we process the cPickle
file into .mat format. 

Implementing the model and getting the variational lower bound results by simply running music_tsbn.m.

If you want to generate the music data, please follow the python code in http://deeplearning.net/tutorial/rnnrbm.html.
